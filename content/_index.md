# Welcome to Loveway.one
### An Exploration of Syncretic Metaphysics

You're here because you're curious about the nature of the unseen world. You sense in your bones that there exists something beyond what your senses show you, something that's witnessed only by leaving the realm of ordinary consciousness and stepping into something...strange. No one can give you a satisfactory explanation for what it is you sense out there. Explanations are for the rational mind and can be picked apart as easily as adopting a different point of view. True understanding transcends rationality to come alive within every aspect of your life. It's when an idea begins to surprise and inspire you that you know you're on to something *real*.

The cornerstone of science is replicable results. It's easy to think that metaphysical experiences can't be duplicated, and therefore aren't science-able, but this misconception is based upon the limitations of our awareness. As we learn to see with multidimensional awareness, to experience life both from *here* and from *beyond*, our minds begin to fill in the gaps and finally grasp that ineffable mystery. In time we will build a framework for understanding, remembering, and sharing its secrets. The ultimate purpose of this process is to find something **true**, something **beautiful**, and something **good** to share with the rest of the world.

We are all already enlightened. Our deepest selves know the truths of life but our [persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona) minds, the parts that have to interact with others, often forget and don't know what do with this knowledge. I'm here to help remind you of what you already know, and to help find some language to bridge the conscious and unconscious awareness.

I'm here to remind you that **Love is the Way to One**.

Blessings on your journey,
