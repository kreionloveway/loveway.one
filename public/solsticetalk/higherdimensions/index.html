<h3 id="non-local-space">Non-Local Space</h3>

<p>The distance between two mind fields directly affects the strength of their interactions, but that distance is not measured exclusively in 3D space. While it is difficult to perceive higher dimensions clearly and even harder to explain them to others, here is a story that helped me to understand.</p>

<p>Cultures around the world have known for a long time that there are three aspects to reality: the physical, where our bodies exist, the mental, where our minds join together and push apart, and the spiritual, where all things come together as one. While no one remembers the true origins of the universe, it is widely accepted that the spiritual reality came first, encompassing and forming the grounds for the mental, which in turn encompasses and forms the grounds for the physical. A good way to understand this is to consider how math helps us to understand physics. Many physical phenomena, such as the behavior of subatomic particles, cannot be modeled or predicted unless math incorporates higher-dimensional transformations. Physics and calculus can explain 3D phenomena, but without the concept of higher dimensions, introduced by Lagrange, Riemann, and Hinton, advanced physics such as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics become impossible. Many of the models that describe our reality only work by transcending it through the power of rationality, intuition, and formal logic. History is one such discipline. Accurate predictions of the future can only be made by incorporating ideas of the past. Our bodies are stuck in the here and now, but our minds are free to roam across time and space. Our spirits are even more empowered, for they can roam across dimensions of possibility.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nestedDimensions.jpg" alt="Nested Dimensions" /></p>

<h3 id="transcending-space-and-time">Transcending Space and Time</h3>

<p>The mental dimension that transcends our physical reality seems to define proximity by resonance of the mind field. The way in which the mind field resonates is affected primarily by four components:
1. The orientation of assemblage point, which feels like emotionally embracing a point of view/attitude.
2. History, or memories and beliefs about the nature of the past.
3. Perspective, or beliefs and thought patterns about the nature of the future.
4. Intention, or the way that energy is flowing between the spiritual body, the mental body, the physical body, onto the object of your awareness.</p>

<p>To be “on the same wavelength” with someone is to have your heart’s focus near to their heart’s focus. With musicians performing together or engineers working on a problem, the thought processes and focuses of the group are similar, which enables their minds to work together more seamlessly. Therefore their mind fields influence each other greatly. Conversely, when someone’s mind is somewhere else, it’s like they’re in another world. Their un-focus can feel like static and be disturbing to the unification of the minds around them.</p>

<h3 id="suspension-of-disbelief">Suspension of Disbelief</h3>

<p>Belief is a powerful tool because it opens the mind to resonance or closes it off into specificity. Our ability to suspend disbelief, to create hypothetical awareness, is our greatest superpower as creative beings. The assemblage point doesn’t care what beliefs the ego holds, it only knows what patterns are being reinforced within the present awareness. This is how we can watch a performance on a 2D screen of pixels and transform that information into a visceral experience of emotion, desire, and enlightenment.</p>

<p>The greatest thing you can do for someone else is to believe in them. This doesn’t mean to buy into their stories and adopt them as your own, it only means lay down your ideas and perceptions and to allow your mind to come into a blank, receptive state. When you try to perceive things as they are, without judgment, you turn off your creative ability for a short time, allowing other creative forces to take the reins and control the unfolding of reality. Conversely, when you don’t hold any beliefs of your own, but accept those of the people and circumstances around you, you’re relinquishing your power as a divine creative being. It’s important to know when to grip reality with the power of your intention, and when to relax and let the flow carry you. There’s no point in going to the movie theater only to be “in your body” and critically analyze the film. That only robs you of the joy of the show. Likewise, there’s no point in relaxing and letting your daily life go by without setting some kind of course for yourself. We all have a purpose in life, a gift we’re meant to share with others, but we can only do this by taking control of the ride every now and then. Belief in yourself and others in the simplest way to do this.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-selves">Multiple Selves</h3>

<p>With introspection, you may come to find that there are many “selves” that make up your self. There’s the biological part of you that wants to feel good, be healthy, and procreate. There’s the social part of you that wants to engage in communion and have a sense of purpose. There’s the mental part of you that’s curious, with a hunger for knowledge. There’s the childlike part that is playful and joyous and sees the good in all things. And there’s the spiritual heart of you, the observer, that sees all things and knows all things without attachment. Within these selves there are smaller selves that represent certain ideologies and systems of belief that you’ve gone through. We all remember believing in magic as a kid, and we’ve all gone through phases where that belief died. We’ve probably all gone through phases of believing in and rejecting a higher power. We’ve gone through phases of self-love and self-loathing, of seeing evil in the world and of believing that there’s good within all people. All these perspectives are true and valid in their own way. The nature of duality is such that many things can be true at once. What matters is the set of active instructions you have “loaded” onto your present awareness.</p>

<p>Each story, each perspective you hold, is like a program saved onto your hard disk drive. You, as the central processor, can load whatever programs you want into your RAM, or active memory. Or, if you’re not in control, you can let the daemons, or automatic background processes, do the loading for you. It doesn’t matter how you operate, so long as you’re happy, and so long as you feel connected to spirit truth. If you don’t, then it’s important to wake yourself up, go into a higher energy state, and do a little reprogramming. However you choose to look at it, the point of power lies is choice itself. Though we can gain influence with things, the only real control we have is over ourselves. Being aware of, accepting, and healing your multiple selves is the first step in becoming truly transdimensional.</p>

<p>Each self that you carry lies in a slightly different location within your transdimensional mind field. This means that if you can move your assemblage point to align with different selves, you can gain a stereoscopic view of that higher reality. Consider that the way we humans transcend time is to hold two different points in mind and to draw conclusions between them. Just like blending two 2D points of view into 3D depth perception, multiple points of historical perspective can be combined to find a higher perspective. This is similar to the fundamental action of moving the assemblage point around in order to get a sense of the higher-dimensional mental space that it occupies. We accomplish this by suspending disbelief and allowing our mind/assemblage point system to move into hypothetical realities.</p>

<h3 id="creation-of-reality">Creation of Reality</h3>

<p>When we speak of other dimensions or realms of awareness we don’t necessarily mean it in a mathematical or abstract sense. We see and know the unity of all things, but there exists duality. Some kind of primordial polarity created this universe and continues to create it through dialectic tension that in turn generates complexity. There are many traditions that do a good job of pointing at these vast, mysterious forces, but the truth of them is easier to sense directly than to try to understand conceptually. It’s the interplay of light and dark, of heat and cold, of expansion and contraction, and we exist right at the fine line of the Goldilocks zone in between them. Some may choose to think of these two poles as heaven and earth, yang and yin, spirit father and spirit mother, mental and physical, absolute and relative, infinite concept and infinite form. But these realities are so similar and so deeply intertwined that we will speak of them simply as <strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong>.</p>

<p>The oneness that transcends this duality is more like <strong>zero</strong>, the place of no dimensions where all things come together at a single point. Some may choose to think of this as Source, God, or Brahma, but we don’t really need to discuss it because, compared to up and down, zero is very simple concept.</p>

<p>The two poles of duality are nestled within each other, but fluctuate between denselyintegrated and weakly entwined in a pattern that goes all the way back to the Big Bang. Up and down can behave quite differently from each other when far apart, or can move in harmony when close together. Their periodic separation and integration produces a sort of <strong>causal dialectic tension</strong> which drives the evolution of the entire universe. This is a key concept, so let’s break it down a little bit.</p>

<p>It seems self-evident that tension is the driving force of evolution. A system is disrupted from balance, then either finds a new stable configuration or else disperses to reform as a new system. The tension exists between its current state and the state of balance that will allow it to persist into the future. Tension is the creative space where growth becomes possible. The tension between up and down is called dialectic because it emerges from a process whereby one pole holds a state, the other pole offers an alternative, then together they find a compromising middle ground. This process is referred to in logic as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Because the whole system is expanding as it goes around and round, it can be represented with a spiral.</p>

<h3 id="two-worlds-of-design">Two Worlds of Design</h3>

<p>Our normal focus is centered upon the world of down, which is considered to be <strong>finite in concept</strong> and <strong>infinite in form</strong>. That is to say, each particle of energy in down reality is well-individuated from the particles around it - at least until we get to the quantum level, which is where the two realms approach zero and converge. You have a physical form that is separate from other physical forms. As a result, each form in down reality is conceptually finite within our minds. But, because energy is always moving and taking on new shapes, and because time is an illusion, material reality is finite in its conception but not in its form. Down has an infinite form that we humans box into finite concepts through our perception.</p>

<p>Up, on the other hand, has the opposite nature. All of its form is pure consciousness energy, as opposed to matter-energy. The energy of consciousness looks the same no matter what channel it’s flowing through. The way we conceptualize up, is infinite and cannot be boxed by human minds. Unlike physical forms, there’s no way to tell where one consciousness ends and another begins, due to the fact that our minds are all connected and our memes - the building blocks of our personalities - are passed on from person to person. In other words, our bodies may be separated by time but our minds are all connected in the present via our shared culture.</p>

<p>Each particle of energy in up can be anything anywhere, all simultaneously - <strong>infinite in concept</strong>. But, it’s the same kind of energy at all points - <strong>finite form</strong>. No matter where you think, your thoughts vary only in their relative position to other packets of thought. Mind is mind, no matter what perspective is informing it. Consider that a photon moves at the speed of light and therefore does not experience time. From its perspective, the photon is emitted, travels through space, interacts with objects, and is absorbed again all in a single instant. It moves so fast that zero time elapses within its frame of reference. Photons are very far into the spectrum of up because they have a finite form that can experience an infinitude of realities all at once.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, up and down can also be thought of as mind and body. Our bodies, though they shift through a variety of subtle changes in form, remain conceptually finite. We are able to look at something and say, “that is my body” or “that is not my body.” Our minds, however, are infinite in concept. We cannot readily distinguish between what thoughts belong to us versus what we’re picking up from the ambient environment, because we’re constantly influenced by the stimuli around us. In fact, it’s nearly impossible to have thoughts without external stimuli.</p>

<p>Psychologists say that more than three days of solitary confinement leads to permanent brain damage. Mind fields are an ecosystem that cannot be sustained in isolation. This implies that minds are composed of or result from the same kind of energy flowing between and among them constantly. We say that mind is a field of energy shared by all beings instantly, across space and time. Physical form is a field of energy that is shared between beings as well, but the difference is time scale. Down occurs over vast, unimaginable stretches of time, which results in finite moment-to-moment concepts. Up occurs instantly, resulting in infinite concepts.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking, “Wait, down can be thought of as infinite in concept as well, just like up can be thought of as infinite in form. It’s all relative, if you see beyond the illusion of time,” well, you’d be somewhat right. We’re really coming up against the limits of our language here. Time is a major source of illusion within our lives. The two worlds are so nested within each other that each has aspects that reflect the other, consistently and across all manifestations. It is our perspective that creates borders and shading. “Well, that’s not very scientific,” you might say. But our goal here isn’t to be scientific. We’re trying to deconstruct duality in order to find the edge of oneness, zero, and improve our ability to see beyond finite dimensions. This process is usually done intuitively, super-consciously, not by following a model within the perspective of our egoic minds. We have to shift from perspective to perspective frequently in order gain new perspectives. Up and down are fields of energy that can be conceptualized or experienced in a multitude of different ways, all depending upon your perspective. Your assemblage point is what manages this shifting, and up and down form the axes or dimensions that it travels through. These concepts might be murky initially, but they’ll become more useful as we explore how energy manifests from higher dimensions into our present experience.</p>
