Welcome to a narrative adventure.

You are the divine avatar of the All, the [One, Two, Three, Six, Four, and Five] joined in the middle.

You are Love seeking itself. You are infinite and having a finite experience. You ar enlightened and acting the part of the savage. You are the dreamer engaged in a process of constant awakening.

You are all these paradoxes and more because you walk the edge between the the Dark and the Light, between the Causal and the Manifest. This is the limit where infinite and finite meet.

This is your call. A portal stands before you in your mind, beckoning you to leave behind the comfort of the familiar and the safety of the known. This is your infinite self daring you to step into the transdimensional Nexus. Will you enter?
