# MIND

*These are the hard problems of consciousness.*

<div align="left">

The physical reality is easy to understand because our minds naturally create a map of our awareness in space and time. This map can be traversed to access memories from different times and places. All you have to do is walk backward from where you are now to where you were then, and you can access each piece of information you remembered along the way. This visual, experiential method of connecting information is called concrete operational cognition and is far more natural than formal operational cognition, which [develops later in life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition#Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development). With formal cognition, the mind moves beyond thinking in terms of concrete objects and begins to form abstract representations of reality that are used to hypothesize and make predictions. The abstract models developed in this mode have a map of their own, but most people are only vaguely and subconsciously aware of their "mental landscape". 

The mental reality is much harder to access because it's contained within the same system that is trying to access it. This mode of thinking is called meta-cognition and it suffers from the same kind of paradoxes as those introduced by [GÃ¶del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) and [Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem): *truth about a system cannot be defined from within that system*. The truth of the physical world must be defined in an external system, the mind. But how can truth about the mind be defined? In culture, perhaps, the "collective mind"? Or is there another, transpersonal system in which cognition occurs?

There are two general theories regarding the nature and origin of consciousness. One is called **materialism** and describes the mind as "software" built upon the "hardware" of the nervous system; the brain is like a computer chip and its thoughts are like its programs. If this is the case then a sufficiently advanced simulation of neurons, or "neural net" ought to be able to replicate consciousness within a computer.

The other theory, **immanence** is less well-defined or documented. It is the belief that the mind acts like a radio tuner receiving information from some ambient field that is then parsed, sorted, and stored within the brain. While materialism denies the plausibility of immanence, the reverse is not true. A model of immanent consciousness can still accept and integrate the reasoning of materialism, and so can be considered without causing cognitive dissonance within the thoughtful philosopher.

We propose that a model of consciousness built entirely within formal mental symbols will be *fundamentally incomplete* and unable to answer certain questions such as:

* How does memory and understanding persist among states of drastically altered consciousness, where the brain waves may be far higher or lower than normal awareness?
* How do phenomenal experiences, the qualia or subjective sensations of being alive, arise from unfelt states such as light being detected and nerves being stimulated?
* How do intuition and creativity, the random-yet-useful connection of information into novel forms, arise?
* How does the subconscious process and store information that is never witnessed by the waking mind?
* Why do people have spiritual experiences that are profound yet exist solely within the mind of the individual? Is all experience collective or is individual experience equally valid?
* If mystical experiences (such as [near-death experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience)) are mostly hallucinatory, then why are certain experiences so common that they [transcend cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_mythology)?

To explore and address these questions we must explore alternate models for how consciousness arises and how it interacts with other information systems. We will explore the possibilities of immanent consciousness using personal and anecdotal evidence from a variety of sources. While the data and conclusions contained herein are not well-tested, we invite you to compare them to your own experiences to see what may serve as a useful model and what may help clarify the things you believe to be true. The only way to find out for sure is to observe, hypothesize, and test.

## Mystical Experience
There are certain aspects of life that cannot be explained, only experienced. Until such experience is had, it can be difficult or even impossible to convey certain topics. Once a person has touched that mystical space, though, they are changed forever and can, under the right conditions, be open enough to hear something useful in what I have to say.

I hope that this work proves useful, and helps you unlock and remember the vast mystical knowledge that lies buried within.
