<h3 id="mind-programs-and-mind-viruses">Mind Programs and Mind Viruses</h3>

<p>Thought forms are patterns of cognition. Programs are thought forms that are so rooted in memory and habit that they begin to express themselves unconsciously. Many programs have a life of their own, due to something about their nature that recombines your thoughts in order to replicate and spread to others. Memes are to mind as genes are to body. Some of these memetic programs are good, and some are maladaptive, serving their own interest first. I’m sure you can think of situations where you really wanted to convince someone of an idea, or to spread a story that you found fascinating. Your motivations for doing this are not always clear. Why do drunk people try so hard to get the people around them drunk? It’s more than just the bandwagon effect. The culture of alcoholism is filled with self-replicating thought forms that pervade our media and entertainment. Most people only give in to these stereotypes when their inhibition is reduced. Like a virus, the thought program wants to spread and reproduce. Beneficial adaptations also reproduce, for example, all of the technology that enables us to live comfortably. Information has a life of its own, though we’re still unsure what exactly that means.</p>

<p>What we do know is that all this information is stored somewhere, in some thing that we call the mind. But what is actually being impressed upon? Is it neurons in the brain? Or something else? Neural pathways have been shown to affect specific behaviors. Putting an electric current to an exposed brain will stimulate certain brain waves and generate experiences and desires depending upon what area is poked. But there’s no section of the brain that can be poked to stimulate creativity, evoke certain memories, erase thought forms, or to affect the subjective sense of self. How and why humans have these subtle, qualitative experiences in addition to normal information-processing experiences is called the “hard problem of consciousness.”</p>

<p>Researchers have found that patients in comas or under general anesthesia produce very little to no brain wave activity, yet when recovered, they may have had dreams, visions, or even memories of conversations they heard while unconscious. Electrodes placed on the skin will pick up little electrical activity, except for a faint hum that occurs at very high frequencies. While some may chalk this up to background noise, Valerie Hunt and her research team have discovered that these faint, high-frequency vibrations correlate to emotional experiences had while the subject was awake. High-frequency electromagnetic waves around the skin continue to hum and react to stimuli when the subject is under anesthesia. Hunt theorized that these high-frequency waves are not the product of the nervous system, but a field of electricity that stimulates it.</p>

<p>There is evidence that aspects of the mind exist outside the brain, somewhat independently of the electrical activity among the. While certain “lower” functions such as breathing, digestion, and muscle control are certainly activated by the brain, the origin of these stimuli is unknown. Many data point to the conclusion that the brain stores memories and channels biological impulses, but has little to nothing to do with the “higher” functions such as willpower, creativity, intuition, and conscience. Individual parts of the brain may contribute to these qualia, but no isolated set of organs can be said to house empathy or produce creativity. These higher functions require input and integration from some additional source of information. The thesis of this work is that our bodies are surrounded in a highfrequency electrical field that is read, like a radio, by subtle organs interacting with the electrical field of the nervous system. This field of consciousness is called the “mind field.”</p>

<h3 id="spectrum-of-consciousness">Spectrum of Consciousness</h3>

<p>Many mystics, intuitives, and healers see consciousness as a spectrum of waves that spans from tens of thousands of hertz to cycles that last billions of years (which is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a hertz). Despite this vast spectrum, we can only interact with frequencies that we resonate with. We only see a tiny portion of the spectrum because most waves are too fast or too slow to stimulate our minds. Lower, brainwave-range frequencies can be detected more easily when a mind is operating at these frequencies. This looks like empathy and interpersonal intuition. You can often tell what another person is feeling because they are radiating their brain waves into the local atmosphere, and we are skilled at picking up on them due to our constant practice. More subtle frequencies, on the other hand, are detected not with mirror neurons but with the high frequencies of the mind field. These impressions are then translated, stepped-down through things like constructs, neuropeptides, and chaos attractor fields, into more dense energy systems that we can read with the waking consciousness.</p>

<p>Our mind fields encode, store, decode, and transmit information constantly, but only within
certain constraints, such as:
* Resonance. The more similar a field is to your own, the more sensitive you’ll be to changes in the other field.
* Intensity. The stronger a field is, the more is can make an effect upon other fields.
* Coherence. A steady, consistent field disturbance takes on a structure of its own, as demonstrated by cymatics.</p>

<h3 id="thought-as-interference-patterns-in-the-mind-field">Thought as Interference Patterns in the Mind Field</h3>

<p>Consider that emotion is a chemical experience elicited by neuronal stimulation. It conveys information between the mind and the body. Pure thought, on the other hand, is not chemical but electrical in nature. Neurons generate electric fields which, when in a stable configuration, produce electromagnetic waves. These waves then crash around inside our mind fields like ripples in a pond. Where two waves collide they combine to become either a stronger or a weaker disturbance in the field. Morphic nodes, the smallest building blocks of thought, occur where electromagnetic waves crash into each other and form a standing wave, or node. Stable nodes are interference patterns that affect the neurons that created them. Neurons generate a field, the field self-organizes like sound waves on a plate, and the resulting cymatic structure then strengthens or weakens connections between neurons, which forms memories. This is the basis for our model of consciousness.</p>

<p>Nodes of thought occur throughout the body and in the empty spaces between atoms. We produce, transform, and receive thought - not just with our brains, but with our entire bodies. Experiments on cognitive ability inside soundproofed Faraday cages show that people think more sluggishly when inside an electromagnetically-dead environment. Conversely, thoughts are clearer inside a magnetically-charged environment. As an interesting but unrelated aside, plants also do exceptionally well in electrostatic-rich environments, due to the enhanced uptake of ionic chemicals and the inhibition of surface tension of water in the leaves. Could plants have a mind field, too? Intuition suggests that all electromagnetically-active objects have the components necessary to support a mind field, and thus have the capacity to form standing-wave interference, or morphic nodes. The difference between living and nonliving mind fields is that growing things have changing field generators and thus evolving patterns or “thoughts”, whereas inert objects have fixed consciousnesses.</p>

<p><img src="/img/electrostaticGreenhouse.jpg" alt="Electrostatic greenhouse technology" /></p>

<h3 id="visualizing-mind-field-transactions">Visualizing Mind Field Transactions</h3>

<p>The effects of electrostatic fields and direct electrical stimulation show that an individual’s mind field is not an isolated system. Like all electromagnetic fields, there is no sharply-defined boundary, only a fall-off in power that increases exponentially with distance from the source. Despite this analogy, there are ways in which a mind can insulate itself from other minds. Some metaphysicists believe that the higher mind chooses its transactions, that fields won’t affect each other unless they want to. I suspect that we are only able to choose as much as we know how to choose. The following visualizations will help you to open and close off your field, helping you to choose how your mind is psychically affected - or at least give some input to the higher mind that chooses for you.</p>

<p>Visualize your mind as a pool of water that grows shallower at the edges, where the signal “falls off”. Your shoreline is unique to the contours of your mind, but it aways changes over time. Rain falls into your pool with a pattern that always changes, and water drains from your pool in a pattern that always changes. But each of these patterns affect each other. They will occasionally reach stable configurations, like sound making cymatics shapes at certain frequencies. The ripple interference pattern is enormously complex. However, each ripple affects the shoreline, the shoreline affects the interference shape, and the shape attracts the next set of droplets, thus forming a feedback loop. Given enough time, the pattern of droplets and ripples will fall into a stable configuration that we call a “thought”. The thought “erodes” the shoreline into a new “memory”. The memory then forms programs that affect the rainfall.</p>

<p>Not to mix my metaphors too much, but the level of detail occurring here is far to great to perceive. We get only a glimpse of the high-level structures of our thought patterns, leaving a vast ocean of detail unobserved beneath the surface. This is called the threshold of awareness. Patterns within patterns may arise only to exist for a moment for disappearing. We only really recognize the thoughts that stick around long enough to make an impression - to erode the shoreline, if you will. Interference patterns that are strong enough or consistent enough to strengthen connections between neurons will form new memories. The transient nature of certain thoughts is part of the reason why “spiritual amnesia” is so common.</p>

<p>If you think this metaphor lacks depth, that’s because we’re not really flat pools at all. We’re more like globes of water, and the “droplets” are like whale song radiating from our nerves, chakras, and meridians. There’s some random noise from the external environment, but our bodies produce so much vibration that the rest is mostly drowned out. That is, until we get sufficiently close to another powerful field. When two people come near each other their fields begin to interact profoundly, due to resonance and dissonance in their heart songs. Each person’s waves influence the other’s in ways that are unique, and therefore somewhat unpredictable at first. When you first get to know someone, their effect upon you may be quite mysterious, until you begin to get a sense of them. When the environmental conditions are highly structured, such as in a musical performance, the interference patterns become highly regular, meaning they become recognizable and predictable much more quickly. This is a powerful learning tool. As groups of individuals interact more and more within the state of oneness fostered by ecstatic dance and song, they develop complex understanding of their field transactions. These labels and stories help them to recognize and interpret the subtleties of their shared mind field experiences. This means that people get better at “reading” each other as time goes on. Those you’ve been open to your entire life are like a book written in a language you know well.</p>
