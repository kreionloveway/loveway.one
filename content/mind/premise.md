Some of our cognitive operations occur within the brain under the conditions supposed by materialism: neurons transmit electric charges whose patterns form memories and behaviors. However, we propose that many important processes occur not in the neurons, but in the interference patterns of the electromagnetic field produced by neurons and the earth's magnetosphere. Patterns of neruonal activity form boundary conditions that influence the formation of standing waves within the electromagnetic field system of a living entitity. These resulting interference patterns influence the growth of neuron connections, forming a feedback loop with the physical brain.

In short, our minds generate an electric field which interacts with the environment and itself, forming into complex patterns that are the direct product of universal laws of electromagnetism and field dynamics. These patterns stimulate nerves in the body, producing sensations and stimulating the formation of memories. These impressions are the basis for higher modes of consciousness including:

* Formal-operational cognition
* Meta-cognition
* Creativity
* Passion
* Intuition
* Empathy
* Flow states
* Mystical states
