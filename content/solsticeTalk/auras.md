### Sensory Interpretation is a Learned Behavior

Every brain can process information from the mind field, but each person has a preference for how that information gets translated into sensory awareness. Some brains will interpret vibratory signals as high-pitched sounds or deep, low tones. Some will see flashes of light, colored orbs, or closed-eye images. Some will even smell subtle odors that can’t be explained by the substances around them. Most people, however, are primarily kinesthetic integrators, meaning they detect energies as if with a sense of touch. These sensations can occur inside the body, out in the environment, or even within other dimensions of space and time. These sensations can feel like shape, warmth, texture, or movement, even buzzing and electric jolts. I personally experience energy like I’m sitting in a pool of water and can feel ripples lapping against my skin. Some waves are so slow or so fast that they can hardly be felt at all. More distant waves, are harder to detect, which is why we’re initially going to practice sensing things nearby, within the aura.

The aura is a common term used to describe the layer of mind field that immediately surroundd the body. It’s the area where your emissions have the strongest interaction with the physical world, before falling off toward quiet. Magnetism, like gravity, theoretically affects things an infinite distance away, but the force falls off so rapidly that it becomes an infinitely small effect pretty quick. For humans, the area of strongest physical influence of the mind field is between one-half and three arm-lengths away from the heart.

Our electromagnetic bodies, or energy bodies radiate transactions from our chakras, mostly from the heart. Fields get their energy from many sources, primarily from metabolism, sunlight, and the electromagnetic field of the Earth. Even inert systems such as rocks and metals are connected to the ambient energy fields around them. Thanks to the influence of ambient energy, these objects vibrate and resonate with fields of their own. Living things have the greatest amount of coherence to their energy, and thus have the most detectable auras. Chaotic systems such as fire, flowing water, and wind move a great amount of energy but without much organization, making their fields less interactive, and thus much less detectable.

Human auras can constrict, expand, or in rare cases even move away from the body altogether. This is due to the non-local nature of the mental plane. During our normal waking state we keep our fields tight and close to our body, which allows less information to pass in or out of our mental experience. At night, while sleeping, the aura opens up and expands, usually filling the room. During some dreams, particularly those of extra-clear lucidity, part of the aura slips into the higher mental dimension and interacts with other fields. Usually this contact is only partial, so distant information gets mixed with local data, resulting in a confused jumble of a dream.

The movement of the aura can be controlled consciously. In dream states this is perceived as a flying sensation when out of body, or as expansion and contraction of awareness when in-body. Have you ever had such a fever that you felt like your body was shrinking and expanding rapidly, to the point where you felt like you could reach out and touch the walls of your room? This is an automatic fluctuation of the aura that helps cleanse local mind field contaminants and promote the healing response. Learning to open the field consciously is crucial to being able to receive subtle information from beyond the threshold of awareness. In fact, the position and openness of the aura is the primary factor in determining where your threshold lies. Other factors include beliefs that filter information, and the location of the your spiritual heart-anchor, or assemblage point.
