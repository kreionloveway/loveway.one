	"content": " Change Your Mind, Change Your Life All of us have the power to transform our lives into anything we can imagine. As divine, creative beings we have the rare gift of self-directed evolution. Our talent for it is so powerful that we do it instinctively, so long as the right conditions exist. What we think, we increase. When we get caught in situations that trap our thoughts, however, we can’t grow. We begin to stagnate, and we suffer. Transforming into new modes of thinking and being is the very spice of life that our souls crave. It is a deep spiritual need that can’t be bought, can’t be taught, and can’t be hoarded. True growth comes only from within, by doing the work, by pushing yourself up against your limits, and transcending them. We all know what this is like because we’ve all done it. Usually the growth is not by choice, and because of that, it’s wild. Messy. There is good to this, but it also comes with complications. What if, instead, we could chart a course of self-directed growth that was safe enough to keep us alive, but tough enough to really push us? Such a challenge can be found in mastery of the mind. And it is not easy.\nThough we may want to change on some level, we’re often held back by willpower being diverted and subverted into fragmented parts of our personality. Thought-forms such as obsession, confusion, addiction - even the survival instinct - all have a say in how we live our lives. What they’re saying isn’t always good or in our best interest. The part of us that wants to change isn’t the only driver with hands on the wheel. Human systems are joint efforts. Each soul is a collection of lifehoods all growing together. Each mind is an array of experiences and idea-memes constantly integrating into higher wisdom. Each body, in particular, is a collection of organisms both native and newcomer. Our bodies, minds, and souls are transacting constantly, trading, invading, and colonizing. Such is the way of life. Bacteria and viruses enter. They either become food, create an infection, or else join up and become a beneficial part of the biosystem.\nIt all adds up to one big tangled mess that can be impossible to sort through. To navigate the complexities of self-hood, particularly the important parts like healing and evolution, you often have to rely upon pure instinct. The spirit of the universe will guide you, so long as your mind is open to listen for it. Yet even this spiritual instinct can be sabotaged by organisms and thought forms that hold their own interest above your own, above the flourishing of the whole. Illnesses both mental and physical will try to cut you off from the source in order to claim that power for themselves and better colonize you. It sounds dramatic, but it’s sort of what happens.\nI’d like you to take a moment to think of some pattern that you know is holding you back from achieving your highest good. Something that you just can’t make progress disarming. Write it in the margin here. Addiction is a great example because it subverts the pleasure centers and fools the mind into thinking it’s making progress that it isn’t, that the addiction has the best interests of the whole at heart even as it eats away at the things that hold the organism together. Self-sabotage is another good example because it creates a story of victimhood that then fulfills its own prophecies and reinforces its story of perpetual failure. Try to think of something that you know is holding you back. If you can’t, but still sense that there is something out there, then just write down, “ignorance of my darkness.”\nIf you think you don’t have inner darkness, you’re wrong. Everyone has darkness. There’s a seed of it buried deep within every soul that forms on this physical plane. It is simply the nature of an evolving universe to have tension arising from conflict. The shadow is an evolutionary force that guides our growth just as much as illumination. Darkness gives us a challenge against which we can struggle and grow.\nIn contrast, there also exists light within every being. Illumination gives us a source of strength and something toward which we can grow. Like a plant, we can’t grow away from darkness. But we can grow toward the light. Unlike a plant, we can condition our minds, to bring light a little closer and accelerate our growth. To do so is not easy, and requires a strong mind with good mental hygiene. Being a creative being and the divine manifestation of a creative universe, what you focus upon is what you increase. So today we will focus upon increasing our ability to choose our evolution. Take a moment to write in the margin your heart’s deepest dream. Choose a question you need answered, or a wish you’d like fulfilled. Choose something you want to see created in the world, no matter how outrageous it may seem. Allow yourself to dream, and hold onto that dream as we move into our first exercise.\n"

	"content": " Introduction You\u0026rsquo;re playing a game of hide and seek, forgetting your true nature in order to revel in the process of remembrance.\nThis game is but a dream, nested inside another dream. You yourself are the dreamer. No, not your body, you. Not your mind. But your self.\nWe all forget the true Self, but isn\u0026rsquo;t it fun to remember? You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be told how to remember, you already know. Just follow your heart.\nYou are powerful. You are creative. You have unique gifts that you are meant to be shared with the world. No one can tell you what those are. No one but you can provide lasting meaning to your life.\nWhat secrets lay hidden within the infinite mystery of this game? Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ll find something beautiful to share with those you love.\nThe first step to charting the unseen dream is to form a model of one\u0026rsquo;s mind, some kind of story from which future stories can be related. This cornerstone story can change with time, but the changing then becomes part of the story itself. Whatever starting point you choose, the ending remains the same. All roads lead to One.\n"

	"content": "In order to draw the light closer to us we need to make some room for it. Let’s take a peak at what that will look like. We’ll do this exercise once now, at the beginning, and once again at the end, after we’ve had a chance to dive into some of the core components.\nI’m going to have to speak figuratively a lot here, because English lacks the language to explain certain things with any reasonable amount of accuracy. In fact, I’m convinced that English is not designed to be specific at all, only relative. Hopefully by the end of this you’ll have a relatively clear idea that this stuff is way too complex to ever be put into words and you must discover the concepts for yourself. But I’ll try to give you a head start.\n Lay back and relax. Use a blanket or t-shirt to block out physical stimuli, giving your body time to ground. Once you feel a shift, or if you’re already feeling calm and centered, draw your attention to your corporeal body. Try to sense all your skin at once. Now move your awareness deeper, into your tissues. Try to feel every muscle, bone, and fiber simultaneously. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your skin, then penetrate down into your body. Using your breath, bring oxygen and electrical energy into your body by imagining slightly tensing your muscles, without actually moving them. Bring your nerves to the edge of action but stop just short of movement. This will release electricity throughout your nervous system and increase your body’s magnetism, which strengthens your local mind field. Once you feel that sense of strength, push the energy outward, expanding a shell of awareness that grows to be at least a foot or two away from your skin. Focus on sensing the edges of that boundary and, like inflating a giant bubble, increase the pressure within your aura until the surface becomes smooth and even. If you sense holes or parts that are difficult to inflate, don’t worry about that for now. These are field disturbances that you can focus on healing later. For now, just create a bubble shield around you as best as you can. Now your aura is charged with extra energy. You are creating a larger well of mental gravity that will draw other mind fields close to yours. This attracts certain thoughts and repels others. So pay attention carefully to what you feel. You may sense the other minds in the room. Try not to make noise or get their attention, but instead be still smooth, like a motionless pool of water. If you like, visualize a gentle sound of static, or rainfall. Otherwise, aim for pure silence within and without. You may feel your awareness begin to shift and become more dreamlike. You may feel like you’re dozing off. This is fine, but continue to focus on charging your aura using your breath. In and out, let your energy flow from your heart, through your skin, and into the air around you. When you can do this while remaining alert, you will feel yourself naturally calm and sharpen. You may begin to remember things from your past or from other altered states. If you have a question or a wish, now is the time to repeat it to yourself once or twice. Just sit and listen for an answer. You will be surprised at the information that comes to you. No matter what arises in your awareness, treat it like raw data and file it away to react to later. Now open your eyes and return to the present a little bit. Identify some form of darkness that has been taking up space in your mind lately. Whether it’s judgment, self-doubt, confusion, addiction, trauma, or unmotivation, pick something you’d like to bring change to. Name this darkness, so that you can gain the traction you need to pull it into a new configuration. Using your breath, push these negative thoughts away from you, to the edge of your awareness. This isn’t a long-term solution, but it does give you the breathing room you need to look at it objectively and try to make some sense of how to grow past it. Press the borders of your field until your aura inflates back into its natural egg shape. Strengthen the boundary by visualizing a hard shell forming around you, one to three feet away from your skin, protecting you from the negativity you’ve ejected. Try to maintain this shell for the duration of this talk.  "

	"content": " Mind Programs and Mind Viruses Thought forms are patterns of cognition. Programs are thought forms that are so rooted in memory and habit that they begin to express themselves unconsciously. Many programs have a life of their own, due to something about their nature that recombines your thoughts in order to replicate and spread to others. Memes are to mind as genes are to body. Some of these memetic programs are good, and some are maladaptive, serving their own interest first. I’m sure you can think of situations where you really wanted to convince someone of an idea, or to spread a story that you found fascinating. Your motivations for doing this are not always clear. Why do drunk people try so hard to get the people around them drunk? It’s more than just the bandwagon effect. The culture of alcoholism is filled with self-replicating thought forms that pervade our media and entertainment. Most people only give in to these stereotypes when their inhibition is reduced. Like a virus, the thought program wants to spread and reproduce. Beneficial adaptations also reproduce, for example, all of the technology that enables us to live comfortably. Information has a life of its own, though we’re still unsure what exactly that means.\nWhat we do know is that all this information is stored somewhere, in some thing that we call the mind. But what is actually being impressed upon? Is it neurons in the brain? Or something else? Neural pathways have been shown to affect specific behaviors. Putting an electric current to an exposed brain will stimulate certain brain waves and generate experiences and desires depending upon what area is poked. But there’s no section of the brain that can be poked to stimulate creativity, evoke certain memories, erase thought forms, or to affect the subjective sense of self. How and why humans have these subtle, qualitative experiences in addition to normal information-processing experiences is called the “hard problem of consciousness.”\nResearchers have found that patients in comas or under general anesthesia produce very little to no brain wave activity, yet when recovered, they may have had dreams, visions, or even memories of conversations they heard while unconscious. Electrodes placed on the skin will pick up little electrical activity, except for a faint hum that occurs at very high frequencies. While some may chalk this up to background noise, Valerie Hunt and her research team have discovered that these faint, high-frequency vibrations correlate to emotional experiences had while the subject was awake. High-frequency electromagnetic waves around the skin continue to hum and react to stimuli when the subject is under anesthesia. Hunt theorized that these high-frequency waves are not the product of the nervous system, but a field of electricity that stimulates it.\nThere is evidence that aspects of the mind exist outside the brain, somewhat independently of the electrical activity among the. While certain “lower” functions such as breathing, digestion, and muscle control are certainly activated by the brain, the origin of these stimuli is unknown. Many data point to the conclusion that the brain stores memories and channels biological impulses, but has little to nothing to do with the “higher” functions such as willpower, creativity, intuition, and conscience. Individual parts of the brain may contribute to these qualia, but no isolated set of organs can be said to house empathy or produce creativity. These higher functions require input and integration from some additional source of information. The thesis of this work is that our bodies are surrounded in a highfrequency electrical field that is read, like a radio, by subtle organs interacting with the electrical field of the nervous system. This field of consciousness is called the “mind field.”\nSpectrum of Consciousness Many mystics, intuitives, and healers see consciousness as a spectrum of waves that spans from tens of thousands of hertz to cycles that last billions of years (which is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a hertz). Despite this vast spectrum, we can only interact with frequencies that we resonate with. We only see a tiny portion of the spectrum because most waves are too fast or too slow to stimulate our minds. Lower, brainwave-range frequencies can be detected more easily when a mind is operating at these frequencies. This looks like empathy and interpersonal intuition. You can often tell what another person is feeling because they are radiating their brain waves into the local atmosphere, and we are skilled at picking up on them due to our constant practice. More subtle frequencies, on the other hand, are detected not with mirror neurons but with the high frequencies of the mind field. These impressions are then translated, stepped-down through things like constructs, neuropeptides, and chaos attractor fields, into more dense energy systems that we can read with the waking consciousness.\nOur mind fields encode, store, decode, and transmit information constantly, but only within certain constraints, such as: * Resonance. The more similar a field is to your own, the more sensitive you’ll be to changes in the other field. * Intensity. The stronger a field is, the more is can make an effect upon other fields. * Coherence. A steady, consistent field disturbance takes on a structure of its own, as demonstrated by cymatics.\nThought as Interference Patterns in the Mind Field Consider that emotion is a chemical experience elicited by neuronal stimulation. It conveys information between the mind and the body. Pure thought, on the other hand, is not chemical but electrical in nature. Neurons generate electric fields which, when in a stable configuration, produce electromagnetic waves. These waves then crash around inside our mind fields like ripples in a pond. Where two waves collide they combine to become either a stronger or a weaker disturbance in the field. Morphic nodes, the smallest building blocks of thought, occur where electromagnetic waves crash into each other and form a standing wave, or node. Stable nodes are interference patterns that affect the neurons that created them. Neurons generate a field, the field self-organizes like sound waves on a plate, and the resulting cymatic structure then strengthens or weakens connections between neurons, which forms memories. This is the basis for our model of consciousness.\nNodes of thought occur throughout the body and in the empty spaces between atoms. We produce, transform, and receive thought - not just with our brains, but with our entire bodies. Experiments on cognitive ability inside soundproofed Faraday cages show that people think more sluggishly when inside an electromagnetically-dead environment. Conversely, thoughts are clearer inside a magnetically-charged environment. As an interesting but unrelated aside, plants also do exceptionally well in electrostatic-rich environments, due to the enhanced uptake of ionic chemicals and the inhibition of surface tension of water in the leaves. Could plants have a mind field, too? Intuition suggests that all electromagnetically-active objects have the components necessary to support a mind field, and thus have the capacity to form standing-wave interference, or morphic nodes. The difference between living and nonliving mind fields is that growing things have changing field generators and thus evolving patterns or “thoughts”, whereas inert objects have fixed consciousnesses.\nVisualizing Mind Field Transactions The effects of electrostatic fields and direct electrical stimulation show that an individual’s mind field is not an isolated system. Like all electromagnetic fields, there is no sharply-defined boundary, only a fall-off in power that increases exponentially with distance from the source. Despite this analogy, there are ways in which a mind can insulate itself from other minds. Some metaphysicists believe that the higher mind chooses its transactions, that fields won’t affect each other unless they want to. I suspect that we are only able to choose as much as we know how to choose. The following visualizations will help you to open and close off your field, helping you to choose how your mind is psychically affected - or at least give some input to the higher mind that chooses for you.\nVisualize your mind as a pool of water that grows shallower at the edges, where the signal “falls off”. Your shoreline is unique to the contours of your mind, but it aways changes over time. Rain falls into your pool with a pattern that always changes, and water drains from your pool in a pattern that always changes. But each of these patterns affect each other. They will occasionally reach stable configurations, like sound making cymatics shapes at certain frequencies. The ripple interference pattern is enormously complex. However, each ripple affects the shoreline, the shoreline affects the interference shape, and the shape attracts the next set of droplets, thus forming a feedback loop. Given enough time, the pattern of droplets and ripples will fall into a stable configuration that we call a “thought”. The thought “erodes” the shoreline into a new “memory”. The memory then forms programs that affect the rainfall.\nNot to mix my metaphors too much, but the level of detail occurring here is far to great to perceive. We get only a glimpse of the high-level structures of our thought patterns, leaving a vast ocean of detail unobserved beneath the surface. This is called the threshold of awareness. Patterns within patterns may arise only to exist for a moment for disappearing. We only really recognize the thoughts that stick around long enough to make an impression - to erode the shoreline, if you will. Interference patterns that are strong enough or consistent enough to strengthen connections between neurons will form new memories. The transient nature of certain thoughts is part of the reason why “spiritual amnesia” is so common.\nIf you think this metaphor lacks depth, that’s because we’re not really flat pools at all. We’re more like globes of water, and the “droplets” are like whale song radiating from our nerves, chakras, and meridians. There’s some random noise from the external environment, but our bodies produce so much vibration that the rest is mostly drowned out. That is, until we get sufficiently close to another powerful field. When two people come near each other their fields begin to interact profoundly, due to resonance and dissonance in their heart songs. Each person’s waves influence the other’s in ways that are unique, and therefore somewhat unpredictable at first. When you first get to know someone, their effect upon you may be quite mysterious, until you begin to get a sense of them. When the environmental conditions are highly structured, such as in a musical performance, the interference patterns become highly regular, meaning they become recognizable and predictable much more quickly. This is a powerful learning tool. As groups of individuals interact more and more within the state of oneness fostered by ecstatic dance and song, they develop complex understanding of their field transactions. These labels and stories help them to recognize and interpret the subtleties of their shared mind field experiences. This means that people get better at “reading” each other as time goes on. Those you’ve been open to your entire life are like a book written in a language you know well.\n"

	"content": " Metaphorical Vision Let’s all agree to disagree about certain ideas and phrasing that I’m using here. Whatever traditions you’re working with, I think we can all agree that there’s something powerful happening within our minds and our bodies that we can’t describe using words. Our people are awakening and evolving so rapidly that no ancient tradition can hold all the answers. There’s wisdom in teachings everywhere, but what’s given to you by other people will only get you so far. The most sustainable sources of power are those you create yourself. The same is true for any wisdom that you did not come by honestly. Unless you create your own stories, your own rituals, and your own tools, you’ll be dependent upon certain external circumstances remaining consistent in order to use those tools. The same goes for plant medicine as it does for totems, guides, and gurus. Only you can free your mind. Here are a few stories that might help along the way.\nEach of these practices and ideas is just a story. It’s all just stories, but that doesn’t make it un-true. Be honest with yourself, know yourself, and every story becomes a metaphor guiding you to higher truth.\nRelationships with Your Stories As you evaluate the stories and practices you develop, it can be extremely helpful to focus on two things: First, watch out for synchronicity, or certain themes that crop up in your life over and over again. Pay attention to numbers, symbols, dejá vú, and other ways that the subconscious might be trying to talk to you. You already have access to so much information that is buried in your subconscious. It’s trying to bubble to the surface in a usable form. Pay attention, give it feedback, and that deeper wisdom will become more clear. Second, allow your stories and other objects to take on a life of their own. Consider - or pretend, if you will - that each thought form you have, each symbol you’re manipulating, carries a life of its own. The power of the creative imagination is such that the more attention you give to symbols, the more they really do take on a life of their own and begin to surprise you with fountains of creativity. Work with a symbol for long enough, infuse it with enough of your essence, and it may become a real force in your life. Personal deity worship, or henotheism, has been practiced in this way since the dawn of history. You can also give your symbols constraints and feedback. Creating smaller, more reliable, mechanical symbols is an art form I’m inventing and choosing to call daemonology.\nWhile it doesn’t entirely matter what you choose to call any given thing, names are still powerful enough that it’s worth taking the time to create them carefully. I say create instead of choose because, ideally, you invent your own language to talk to the universe. Any other word you’ve been taught is surrounded by all these constructs that piggy-back on the word in order to create the context needed to explain it to you in the first place. Only pure sounds and vibrations are free enough of such clutter to carry the necessary accuracy and succinct-ness to evoke pure energies. Using a word is highly preferable to silence because sound is the rawest form of vibration, and the one form that we have the most control over. By creating a new word that means exactly one thing to you and is used the same way over and over, you create a consistent and reliable impression upon your mind field. Once that impression is synced to an energy signature, you can evoke that energy literally on command by recalling to yourself your word of power.\nSpiritual Amnesia The final thing I’m going to say about stories is an important counterpoint. It’s important to stay grounded even while your mind expands and becomes more powerful. Secret words and rituals are important, but incomplete until you’ve found some way to share your gifts with others. All the intense experiences and illumination in the world mean nothing if they don’t make it back into physical reality. The difference between a shaman and a madman is that the shaman remembers what they see and finds a way to share it with others. The madman is selfish with their wisdom, and it drives them nuts.\nSpiritual amnesia, or a lack of integration, will plague you until you get good at encoding your experience into physical reality. So share your stories with others! In his Youtube series “Mind Field” (not related to this metaphysics), Vsauce undergoes three days of sensory deprivation and comes to realize:\n “\u0026hellip;how important it is to share your experience. If you only have your own experience, you’re not fully having them. You have to have someone else to listen to them and react to them, and then you’ve fully experienced them.”\n Spiritual amnesia is more common than anyone remembers. I’ve seen people have powerful visions and then immediately forget them, or witness miracles only to black out. The mind is able to view only what it’s prepared to view, which is why it’s so important for us to practice. You will, over the course of your journey, see and learn so many incredible things that you’ll probably forget. But that’s okay. Because despite all the stories and magical tools, what we’re really training isn’t our egos or our ability to tell stories. We’re training our souls.\nThese understandings must become reflexive within you, so that you can recall them in your sleep. You’ll know you’re making progress when you begin to practice in your dreams. You’ll know you’re making progress when you begin to see your dreams as metaphoric stories, and interpret them while in the dream. You’ll know you’re making progress when you begin to feel a deepness growing in your soul, an unshakable strength that feeds your life with an overflowing cup. You’ll know you’re making progress when you no longer need the stories.\n"

	"content": " Sensory Interpretation is a Learned Behavior Every brain can process information from the mind field, but each person has a preference for how that information gets translated into sensory awareness. Some brains will interpret vibratory signals as high-pitched sounds or deep, low tones. Some will see flashes of light, colored orbs, or closed-eye images. Some will even smell subtle odors that can’t be explained by the substances around them. Most people, however, are primarily kinesthetic integrators, meaning they detect energies as if with a sense of touch. These sensations can occur inside the body, out in the environment, or even within other dimensions of space and time. These sensations can feel like shape, warmth, texture, or movement, even buzzing and electric jolts. I personally experience energy like I’m sitting in a pool of water and can feel ripples lapping against my skin. Some waves are so slow or so fast that they can hardly be felt at all. More distant waves, are harder to detect, which is why we’re initially going to practice sensing things nearby, within the aura.\nThe aura is a common term used to describe the layer of mind field that immediately surroundd the body. It’s the area where your emissions have the strongest interaction with the physical world, before falling off toward quiet. Magnetism, like gravity, theoretically affects things an infinite distance away, but the force falls off so rapidly that it becomes an infinitely small effect pretty quick. For humans, the area of strongest physical influence of the mind field is between one-half and three arm-lengths away from the heart.\nOur electromagnetic bodies, or energy bodies radiate transactions from our chakras, mostly from the heart. Fields get their energy from many sources, primarily from metabolism, sunlight, and the electromagnetic field of the Earth. Even inert systems such as rocks and metals are connected to the ambient energy fields around them. Thanks to the influence of ambient energy, these objects vibrate and resonate with fields of their own. Living things have the greatest amount of coherence to their energy, and thus have the most detectable auras. Chaotic systems such as fire, flowing water, and wind move a great amount of energy but without much organization, making their fields less interactive, and thus much less detectable.\nHuman auras can constrict, expand, or in rare cases even move away from the body altogether. This is due to the non-local nature of the mental plane. During our normal waking state we keep our fields tight and close to our body, which allows less information to pass in or out of our mental experience. At night, while sleeping, the aura opens up and expands, usually filling the room. During some dreams, particularly those of extra-clear lucidity, part of the aura slips into the higher mental dimension and interacts with other fields. Usually this contact is only partial, so distant information gets mixed with local data, resulting in a confused jumble of a dream.\nThe movement of the aura can be controlled consciously. In dream states this is perceived as a flying sensation when out of body, or as expansion and contraction of awareness when in-body. Have you ever had such a fever that you felt like your body was shrinking and expanding rapidly, to the point where you felt like you could reach out and touch the walls of your room? This is an automatic fluctuation of the aura that helps cleanse local mind field contaminants and promote the healing response. Learning to open the field consciously is crucial to being able to receive subtle information from beyond the threshold of awareness. In fact, the position and openness of the aura is the primary factor in determining where your threshold lies. Other factors include beliefs that filter information, and the location of the your spiritual heart-anchor, or assemblage point.\n"

	"content": " Lay back and relax. Close your eyes and breathe for a moment, allowing your body to ground and become more present. Now, without opening your eyes, raise your hands towards each other and hold them about a foot apart. Focus on the sensations of your hands. Try to feel each finger clearly, the nails, the muscles, and particularly the skin. Bring your focus to your hands, as if you’re getting ready to move them but holding back just shy of motion. This brings extra electromagnetic energy and subtle energy from the nervous system and ambient environment into the hands, which increases the amplitude (or power) of the field surrounding them. Now imagine you move your dominate hand to touch the other, palm to palm, without actually moving either hand. Reach through your dominate hand to make contact with the subordinate hand’s field, which should be tucked close to the skin due to our visualization. Now you may feel something, a presence or warmth or tingling. Sensations are likely to be stronger in the hand that’s not moving, due to the fact that it’s easier to sense field disturbances/interactions that are close to the skin. Your projecting hand may feel something as well, but because it’s sensing from a greater distance, there will be more “noise” in the signal. Maintaining your current focus, slightly wave your dominate hand back and forth, moving its field to press harder or more lightly against your other hand’s field. You ought to really feel something now, perhaps pressure synced up with your movements. Experiment with moving either hand back and forth and you can almost feel the pressure increase and decrease between them. If you think this sensation is being perceived as a trick of the mind, then try doing this with a partner, each of you using one hand only. With your eyes closed, there is no way for gross sensations to trick you, yet you will still feel the waves of energy emanating from each other. The hands are the most sensitive and powerful channels into and out of the body. If you still don’t feel anything, try to expand your threshold of perception by lowering your standards of expectation. You’re not necessarily looking for a physical sensation, because that’s just one way the brain can process the mind field information. Instead look for any other perceptions you’re having that are synced up with the movements. Do you feel waves of lightness? Hear any buzzing sounds? See any lights with your eyes closed? Everyone perceives subtle energy differently. Developing your senses is a lifelong process, but sensing your own aura is the first and simplest step. Remember that you’re creating a language with your body, learning to understand its information in a way that works for you both. The data won’t always be in a form you’re expecting.  "

	"content": " The Anchor in Multidimensional Space Everyone has an assemblage point, a place where energy flows freely between the physical and energy bodies. Carlos Castaneda coined this term in his book The Power of Silence and described it as a heart-center that anchors a person within the spiritual dimensions. He claimed that everyone’s assemblage point traveled slightly, but “sorcerers” (source-rers) could move theirs at will.\nThe position of the assemblage point relative to the body is the dominant influence upon a person’s mental and spiritual experience. It’s like a point of view within the multiverse, varying from far-out to ungrounded to fully present to hyper-rational. It affects emotions, energy, and motivation. Learning to sense and move the assemblage point enables you to connect with or insulate yourself from other mind fields.\nIt’s difficult to accurately describe the assemblage point, or how to sense it, or how to move it. Most people must meditate and practice for many years before they begin to build concrete awareness of their center. Once you do begin to master the point, you can ride it to travel through the realms of mind and astral planes. Unfortunately, it’s something you have to learn to do for yourself. Simply having a concept can be useful, because the story will help you to recognize when you’re experiencing a shift in your assemblage point. Once you’ve experienced enough shifts, you can compare the viewpoints to gain a higher perspective.\nIf you ever feel a sudden shift in your energy accompanied by an emotional reaction (or sudden lack thereof), ask yourself if you can feel something that was once centered at a certain point, now centered somewhere else. Like all higher dimensional awareness, we can really only get a good image of a thing by witnessing its movement. So pay attention to your emotions and pay attention to the physical sensations of the energy in your body. Emotions are the bridge between the physical and mental, and sensations are the bridge between the mental and the mind field.\nIt’s easy for the assemblage point to get misaligned from the spiritual heart center that it prefers to occupy. Distortions such as negative stories can subvert intention and divert the assembly from the way of love, resulting in a diminished energy flow. Our mind fields have a heart center where energy streams in from the higher dimensions, but the body can become misaligned due to various stresses. A misaligned assemblage point is often the result of trying to be something other than what the soul naturally desires, which is to be a being of love. If you feel diminished vitality and frustration on a soul level, try to bring more love into your life by expressing it and receiving it from/to yourself and others. Love is food for the heart, and a healthy heart results in a healthy assemblage point.\n"

	"content": " Take a moment to sense where your focus is oriented. Do you feel a lot of energy in your head? Legs? Hands? Do you feel grounded, like you’re “in your body”, or do you feel light and airy, like you’re floating off in space? Take a moment to gauge your emotions. Do you feel peaceful or a little anxious, like there’s something you need to do? Are you feeling highly stimulated or somewhat drowsy? Lastly, ask yourself where your heart is. Do you feel a sense of well-being and belonging in this location, or are you halfway off to somewhere else? Now, rub your hands together vigorously for ten seconds. Smack yourself gently but firmly three times on your mid-sternum, directly above the heart chakra. Take a moment to check in again, and sense what, if any, changes have occurred in your energy body. Do you feel slightly less grounded, perhaps with a disquieted or uneasy sensation? Applying energy to the front of the assemblage point can cause it to shift backward and tilt downward, which brings your energy down with it. Now rub your hands together again and pat yourself firmly on the back, directly between the shoulder blades. Do so six times, three with each hand. Even better, have a neighbor do it so they can get a good angle for you. Check in again, and see if you don’t notice an immediate shift in your presence. Applying energy to the back is considered to shift the assemblage point forward and tilted up, raising joy and elation. To finish, hop up and down and shake your body a bit. This helps to reset the assemblage point and shake away any funky feelings you built up.  "

	"content": " Non-Local Space The distance between two mind fields directly affects the strength of their interactions, but that distance is not measured exclusively in 3D space. While it is difficult to perceive higher dimensions clearly and even harder to explain them to others, here is a story that helped me to understand.\nCultures around the world have known for a long time that there are three aspects to reality: the physical, where our bodies exist, the mental, where our minds join together and push apart, and the spiritual, where all things come together as one. While no one remembers the true origins of the universe, it is widely accepted that the spiritual reality came first, encompassing and forming the grounds for the mental, which in turn encompasses and forms the grounds for the physical. A good way to understand this is to consider how math helps us to understand physics. Many physical phenomena, such as the behavior of subatomic particles, cannot be modeled or predicted unless math incorporates higher-dimensional transformations. Physics and calculus can explain 3D phenomena, but without the concept of higher dimensions, introduced by Lagrange, Riemann, and Hinton, advanced physics such as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics become impossible. Many of the models that describe our reality only work by transcending it through the power of rationality, intuition, and formal logic. History is one such discipline. Accurate predictions of the future can only be made by incorporating ideas of the past. Our bodies are stuck in the here and now, but our minds are free to roam across time and space. Our spirits are even more empowered, for they can roam across dimensions of possibility.\nTranscending Space and Time The mental dimension that transcends our physical reality seems to define proximity by resonance of the mind field. The way in which the mind field resonates is affected primarily by four components: 1. The orientation of assemblage point, which feels like emotionally embracing a point of view/attitude. 2. History, or memories and beliefs about the nature of the past. 3. Perspective, or beliefs and thought patterns about the nature of the future. 4. Intention, or the way that energy is flowing between the spiritual body, the mental body, the physical body, onto the object of your awareness.\nTo be “on the same wavelength” with someone is to have your heart’s focus near to their heart’s focus. With musicians performing together or engineers working on a problem, the thought processes and focuses of the group are similar, which enables their minds to work together more seamlessly. Therefore their mind fields influence each other greatly. Conversely, when someone’s mind is somewhere else, it’s like they’re in another world. Their un-focus can feel like static and be disturbing to the unification of the minds around them.\nSuspension of Disbelief Belief is a powerful tool because it opens the mind to resonance or closes it off into specificity. Our ability to suspend disbelief, to create hypothetical awareness, is our greatest superpower as creative beings. The assemblage point doesn’t care what beliefs the ego holds, it only knows what patterns are being reinforced within the present awareness. This is how we can watch a performance on a 2D screen of pixels and transform that information into a visceral experience of emotion, desire, and enlightenment.\nThe greatest thing you can do for someone else is to believe in them. This doesn’t mean to buy into their stories and adopt them as your own, it only means lay down your ideas and perceptions and to allow your mind to come into a blank, receptive state. When you try to perceive things as they are, without judgment, you turn off your creative ability for a short time, allowing other creative forces to take the reins and control the unfolding of reality. Conversely, when you don’t hold any beliefs of your own, but accept those of the people and circumstances around you, you’re relinquishing your power as a divine creative being. It’s important to know when to grip reality with the power of your intention, and when to relax and let the flow carry you. There’s no point in going to the movie theater only to be “in your body” and critically analyze the film. That only robs you of the joy of the show. Likewise, there’s no point in relaxing and letting your daily life go by without setting some kind of course for yourself. We all have a purpose in life, a gift we’re meant to share with others, but we can only do this by taking control of the ride every now and then. Belief in yourself and others in the simplest way to do this.\nMultiple Selves With introspection, you may come to find that there are many “selves” that make up your self. There’s the biological part of you that wants to feel good, be healthy, and procreate. There’s the social part of you that wants to engage in communion and have a sense of purpose. There’s the mental part of you that’s curious, with a hunger for knowledge. There’s the childlike part that is playful and joyous and sees the good in all things. And there’s the spiritual heart of you, the observer, that sees all things and knows all things without attachment. Within these selves there are smaller selves that represent certain ideologies and systems of belief that you’ve gone through. We all remember believing in magic as a kid, and we’ve all gone through phases where that belief died. We’ve probably all gone through phases of believing in and rejecting a higher power. We’ve gone through phases of self-love and self-loathing, of seeing evil in the world and of believing that there’s good within all people. All these perspectives are true and valid in their own way. The nature of duality is such that many things can be true at once. What matters is the set of active instructions you have “loaded” onto your present awareness.\nEach story, each perspective you hold, is like a program saved onto your hard disk drive. You, as the central processor, can load whatever programs you want into your RAM, or active memory. Or, if you’re not in control, you can let the daemons, or automatic background processes, do the loading for you. It doesn’t matter how you operate, so long as you’re happy, and so long as you feel connected to spirit truth. If you don’t, then it’s important to wake yourself up, go into a higher energy state, and do a little reprogramming. However you choose to look at it, the point of power lies is choice itself. Though we can gain influence with things, the only real control we have is over ourselves. Being aware of, accepting, and healing your multiple selves is the first step in becoming truly transdimensional.\nEach self that you carry lies in a slightly different location within your transdimensional mind field. This means that if you can move your assemblage point to align with different selves, you can gain a stereoscopic view of that higher reality. Consider that the way we humans transcend time is to hold two different points in mind and to draw conclusions between them. Just like blending two 2D points of view into 3D depth perception, multiple points of historical perspective can be combined to find a higher perspective. This is similar to the fundamental action of moving the assemblage point around in order to get a sense of the higher-dimensional mental space that it occupies. We accomplish this by suspending disbelief and allowing our mind/assemblage point system to move into hypothetical realities.\nCreation of Reality When we speak of other dimensions or realms of awareness we don’t necessarily mean it in a mathematical or abstract sense. We see and know the unity of all things, but there exists duality. Some kind of primordial polarity created this universe and continues to create it through dialectic tension that in turn generates complexity. There are many traditions that do a good job of pointing at these vast, mysterious forces, but the truth of them is easier to sense directly than to try to understand conceptually. It’s the interplay of light and dark, of heat and cold, of expansion and contraction, and we exist right at the fine line of the Goldilocks zone in between them. Some may choose to think of these two poles as heaven and earth, yang and yin, spirit father and spirit mother, mental and physical, absolute and relative, infinite concept and infinite form. But these realities are so similar and so deeply intertwined that we will speak of them simply as up and down.\nThe oneness that transcends this duality is more like zero, the place of no dimensions where all things come together at a single point. Some may choose to think of this as Source, God, or Brahma, but we don’t really need to discuss it because, compared to up and down, zero is very simple concept.\nThe two poles of duality are nestled within each other, but fluctuate between denselyintegrated and weakly entwined in a pattern that goes all the way back to the Big Bang. Up and down can behave quite differently from each other when far apart, or can move in harmony when close together. Their periodic separation and integration produces a sort of causal dialectic tension which drives the evolution of the entire universe. This is a key concept, so let’s break it down a little bit.\nIt seems self-evident that tension is the driving force of evolution. A system is disrupted from balance, then either finds a new stable configuration or else disperses to reform as a new system. The tension exists between its current state and the state of balance that will allow it to persist into the future. Tension is the creative space where growth becomes possible. The tension between up and down is called dialectic because it emerges from a process whereby one pole holds a state, the other pole offers an alternative, then together they find a compromising middle ground. This process is referred to in logic as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Because the whole system is expanding as it goes around and round, it can be represented with a spiral.\nTwo Worlds of Design Our normal focus is centered upon the world of down, which is considered to be finite in concept and infinite in form. That is to say, each particle of energy in down reality is well-individuated from the particles around it - at least until we get to the quantum level, which is where the two realms approach zero and converge. You have a physical form that is separate from other physical forms. As a result, each form in down reality is conceptually finite within our minds. But, because energy is always moving and taking on new shapes, and because time is an illusion, material reality is finite in its conception but not in its form. Down has an infinite form that we humans box into finite concepts through our perception.\nUp, on the other hand, has the opposite nature. All of its form is pure consciousness energy, as opposed to matter-energy. The energy of consciousness looks the same no matter what channel it’s flowing through. The way we conceptualize up, is infinite and cannot be boxed by human minds. Unlike physical forms, there’s no way to tell where one consciousness ends and another begins, due to the fact that our minds are all connected and our memes - the building blocks of our personalities - are passed on from person to person. In other words, our bodies may be separated by time but our minds are all connected in the present via our shared culture.\nEach particle of energy in up can be anything anywhere, all simultaneously - infinite in concept. But, it’s the same kind of energy at all points - finite form. No matter where you think, your thoughts vary only in their relative position to other packets of thought. Mind is mind, no matter what perspective is informing it. Consider that a photon moves at the speed of light and therefore does not experience time. From its perspective, the photon is emitted, travels through space, interacts with objects, and is absorbed again all in a single instant. It moves so fast that zero time elapses within its frame of reference. Photons are very far into the spectrum of up because they have a finite form that can experience an infinitude of realities all at once.\nAs you may have guessed, up and down can also be thought of as mind and body. Our bodies, though they shift through a variety of subtle changes in form, remain conceptually finite. We are able to look at something and say, “that is my body” or “that is not my body.” Our minds, however, are infinite in concept. We cannot readily distinguish between what thoughts belong to us versus what we’re picking up from the ambient environment, because we’re constantly influenced by the stimuli around us. In fact, it’s nearly impossible to have thoughts without external stimuli.\nPsychologists say that more than three days of solitary confinement leads to permanent brain damage. Mind fields are an ecosystem that cannot be sustained in isolation. This implies that minds are composed of or result from the same kind of energy flowing between and among them constantly. We say that mind is a field of energy shared by all beings instantly, across space and time. Physical form is a field of energy that is shared between beings as well, but the difference is time scale. Down occurs over vast, unimaginable stretches of time, which results in finite moment-to-moment concepts. Up occurs instantly, resulting in infinite concepts.\nIf you’re thinking, “Wait, down can be thought of as infinite in concept as well, just like up can be thought of as infinite in form. It’s all relative, if you see beyond the illusion of time,” well, you’d be somewhat right. We’re really coming up against the limits of our language here. Time is a major source of illusion within our lives. The two worlds are so nested within each other that each has aspects that reflect the other, consistently and across all manifestations. It is our perspective that creates borders and shading. “Well, that’s not very scientific,” you might say. But our goal here isn’t to be scientific. We’re trying to deconstruct duality in order to find the edge of oneness, zero, and improve our ability to see beyond finite dimensions. This process is usually done intuitively, super-consciously, not by following a model within the perspective of our egoic minds. We have to shift from perspective to perspective frequently in order gain new perspectives. Up and down are fields of energy that can be conceptualized or experienced in a multitude of different ways, all depending upon your perspective. Your assemblage point is what manages this shifting, and up and down form the axes or dimensions that it travels through. These concepts might be murky initially, but they’ll become more useful as we explore how energy manifests from higher dimensions into our present experience.\n"

	"content": " The Unique Enfolding of Polarity Differentiates Mind Fields If the world of down is infinitely diverse and the world of up is infinitely unified, then how do the two ever meet? We humans clearly have mental experiences that differ from one another, yet are similar in many fundamental ways. This is because mind is not localized, but infinite in concept. The spectrum of consciousness spans the two dimensions of up and down. Human souls seem to be right in the middle of the spectrum - or at least it appears that way to us due to the fact that we are always in the very center of wherever we are looking. Life force seems to be the bridge that connects points along these two poles, moving energy up and down the spectrum. Consciousness is the signal and we living creatures, as stewards of it, are privileged to be the channel. We live with one foot in material reality and one foot in infinite spirit.\nEach soul is a ship swimming through two vast fields of energy simultaneously. As the assemblage point moves it folds the two forces together seamlessly to create a manifestation of pure experience. This enfolding forms a sort of gravity well within the mind field that attracts thoughts together and maintains the integrity of the field. The strength of the folding can then attract or repel thought waves from other fields depending upon how they resonate.\nThe thing that most differentiates one mind from another is the manner in which it folds reality together to unify the realms of up and down. In other words, the thing that makes you you is how you perceive the world, which is related to your assemblage point, and what you believe about the information you’ve integrated, which is related to your intentions. These two components form the core of how you manifest your reality. Assemblage point is like your current location, but intention is like your momentum, the way you steer your ship. What makes you you is your unique position and movement through the multiverse.\nThe mind fields of two people who are moving together will resonate and fortify each other, unifying to form a more stable system. When you spend time with people you love who affect you in this way, your assemblage points will begin to fold reality in more or less the same manner. As this progresses your minds come closer and closer together until they begin to perceive and intend the same way. You literally begin to merge into one mind field. It is as if the two minds are joined, but actually they’re just so close together that they are mirroring each other perfectly. This is a functional form of telepathy, but it’s less transmitting/receiving than it is a mutual channeling of the same ambient mind experience. This magnetic bond can be broken with time and space, but the location of closeness, once known, can always be found again.\nWhen two people hold opposing views and vibrations then they move far away from each other in the mind field. The field transaction between them becomes disturbing and disharmonizing. This can be experienced as confusion, disgust, enervation, or even hatred. Political polarization is a form of dissonance taken to the collective level. Released from the gravity of shared values, the minds of our people are moving rapidly away from each other on the mental plane, fracturing our shared reality.\nConflicts Between Mind Fields Now for the hard talk. One way to find peace with an opposed person is to reduce your intention and allow theirs to take over. Stop folding your reality and simply allow yourself to exist within theirs. You relax control in order to join the other person within their dream. You talk to them on their terms, you play their game by their rules without pushing things too hard. It sounds bad, but it’s what we do all the time in order to coexist within society. It’s called compromise, and it’s an art form to do it well without forgetting your core beliefs and values. Compromise is a useful tool and absolutely critical in times of emergency when groups need to work together. But over the long run, it’s not so great for the health of the soul.\nRelaxing control of your reality only inhibits your spiritual evolution. Unfortunately, we feel pressured to do so by many closed-minded people who are guilty of what I call the “alpha dog complex”. Most people become intensely uncomfortable when faced with those who radiate a powerful mind field enfoldment that they don’t understand. Instinctive fear of the unknown motivates some to attack these realities that don’t fit into their paradigm. In childhood it looks like bullying and teasing. As teens it becomes cliques and peer pressure. Adults will find subtle means to express their displeasure, often manifesting as emotional manipulation or abuse. In religion it looks like orthodoxy and blasphemy: “Only those who accept our One True Path are saved, while all others are damned.” These basic forms of paradigm conflict exist even within in our economics, where neoliberal capitalism requires centralized currency, advertising, global markets, limitations of political power, and free trade (meaning countries can’t set their own boundaries). States that try to maintain their sovereignty and their own way of doing things are subverted by the wealth and power flowing from neighboring countries that are working together in the same paradigm. Our global economic machine is incredibly productive, but its cost is heavy.\nOne of the major things that I believe is wrong with the world - one of the reasons we feel a lack of something spiritual - is that too many people are trying to colonize the mind spaces of others, dividing the world up into systems of us and them, of beliefs that don’t play nicely with each other. We tell ourselves we do this for a multitude of reasons - for comfort, security, freedom - but ultimately it is done for power. The power to control your environment instead adapting and accepting it as it is. This is necessary for survival but in our ignorance we do it too much, on an individual scale and as a collective. As a result, our factions grow larger with every generation, gobbling up smaller cultures that don’t have the means to maintain their core integrity. Our minds are unifying all across the globe, but losing our individuality. We have access to more information and entertainment than ever before. But the cost to us is paid by our wild souls, our peace of mind, and our heart’s unique expression. If we could only find a way to live without trying to control the beliefs of others, we might create enough space in the mind field for more authentic spirituality to arise.\nThe ideal situation would be one in which our minds remain connected through a set of core agreements that unify some aspects of our reality, but still make enough room for us to create our own beliefs and values - to find our own unique assemblage points. When we practice acceptance and nonjudgment we free each other’s mind fields to be as they are, without forcing them to come into harmony. Yes, we technically have all had this freedom all along, but we come to it through a long and bitter struggle, opposed every step of the way by those who want to use our conformity to extract profit or to feel more comfortable within their lives. Ultimately, it’s not enough to practice acceptance and nonjudgment. We must also practice radical fearlessness in order to remain connected to each other. We can’t let ourselves be intimidated by those who live in worlds we don’t understand. Otherwise we’ll continue to fly apart and lose contact with each other, with the gifts and stimulation we have to offer each other.\n(Do these topics trigger a reaction in you? Check in and see if you can feel a different energy polarity within you. If your assemblage point has moved from detached interest to somewhere else, where is it now? )\nAs in all things, there’s a balance to be sought. We maintain the sovereignty of our own fields but try to remain open enough to interact with others. The best way seek this middle ground is to practice. When we feel too closed off and under-stimulated, we open the field and draw new energies in. When we feel anxious and over-stimulated, we close the field and give ourselves time to adjust. I call this “breathing the field”.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " Part A: Closing the Field  Beginning in a calm, grounded state, bring your focus to the surface of your skin. Start with the skin on your hands, then expand your awareness to include all the skin all over your body. Try to feel it all at once, to get a gestalt or summary impression of its sensation. Increase your focus by imagining tiny vibrations in your skin, like a shiver that’s too fast and too faint to perceive. Increase these vibrations until you feel a slight buzzing, humming, or warming sensation. Using your breath, push these vibrations out into your aura, like you’re inflating a balloon. Fill the space around you until you find the natural “edge” of your field, where the energy resists expanding beyond. For most people this is one-half to three arm-lengths away. Don’t let your mind touch anything outside this radius. With a few more breaths, increase the pressure in your aura. Visualize a hard shell forming around the boundary. Tell the energy you generated to protect you. If it helps, say out loud, “Only love may enter my sacred space.” Set an intention for the duration of this shield. Three minute should do the trick. It may help seal the energy to visualize two counter-rotating tetrahedrons, also known as the merkaba. This is symbolic of the enfolding of up and down into experience. 7. Enjoy a little mental space.  Part B: Kettling the Field  Imagine putting on very warm clothes and wrapping yourself in a down blanket. The insulation traps the energy you generate, keeping it near to your body. With the closed container from the previous step in place, you’ll begin to grow warmer and more stifled over time. Visualize this heat building up like water boiling in a tea kettle. Imagine the sensation of filling your lungs as full as you can. You can hold your breath for little stints, but only for short moments - you need to keep using your breathing to pump energy into your kettle. Continue to imagine the sensation of fullness, and extend that sensation out into your aura. Grab the outer edges of your aura and slowly bring it closer to your body. Maintain the cohesion of the shell and don’t let it burst yet. Consider how your assemblage point reacts to this state. While useful in small doses, too much can quickly lead to stagnation and rot. When injured or sick, closing the field and increasing its pressure can stimulate the body’s natural healing response. Injured fields often leak energy, so focusing on closing and warming can help counteract the energy loss.  Part C: Opening the Field  Considering that this step releases a lot of energy at once, first take a moment, once again, to center yourself. Bless the energy you’ve gathered and see what you’re about to do as a form of releasing good vibes out into the world. Say something along the lines of, “This is a gift of love to the world.” Take deep breath. Hold it. Prepare to dissolve your shell and simultaneously expel all your energy out of your body in every direction. Don’t just let it escape through your hands and chakras, but let it stream out of your back, your legs, your feet. Exhale sharply. Expel the energy. Open the field. Let your senses travel out with the energy, spreading to the far corners of the land. See the blessings you created touching all the nature, beings, and mind fields all around you. Allow your mind to gently touch everything around you. Share the gift of your love through this touch. Consider how your assemblage point feels in this state. After the tension of the previous step, it likely feels much more comfortable. Be warned, however, that too long in an open state can lead to overstimulation and ungrounded-ness.  Part D: Freezing the Field  Imagine taking off all your clothes and standing naked in a cold wind. Let go of all the heat around you and let it drain away into the ether, into the ground, into the air around you. Calm all the sensation in your mind, in your body, in your skin. Imagine laying a hand on the shivering vibration of your field, soothing it to sleep. Close your eyes. Ease your mind by sensing the electrical activity in your brain and urging it to blank stillness. Try imagining static. It’s very difficult to maintain true blankness for any period of time. After you feel thoughts begin to intrude again, suss out your assemblage point and see how you feel at the end of this practice. You’ve just moved a lot of energy in a short time. What does your field require now? Close up your field a little if you feel drained. Open it further if you feel exuberant or over-stimulated.  "

	"content": " Bouncing Between Known Assemblage Points Hopefully by this point your energy will have shifted noticeably a few times. Hopefully you’ve gained an inkling of what its like for your assemblage point to move to different locations in the up/down matrix. The location of your point is about more than just how you feel, it’s a question of what matters are close to your heart, of what you desire, and what now weighs upon your mind. If we were to do the “Creating Space” exercise again, what darkness would you name? Do you now see anything in a different light? These questions aren’t meant to be banal, nor are they meant to be seriously answered. Instead, they’re meant to be sensed intuitively as a line of inquiry that, when followed, can help guide you back to the state of mind you’re now occupying.\nYou see, once you’ve identified a place that your assemblage point goes to, it becomes like a marker on your map. You’re able to get back to that easier and easier with practice. I’m sure you can think of a few states of mind that you’re able to instantly snap to. Well, states like grounded, blankness, open field, kettling, closed field, freezing, charging, and channeling are all points that you can find your way back to. And these states are only the local nodes. Farther out are states of consciousness so altered that reality dissolves into strange and unimaginable experiences. With practice, you may even be able to occupy multiple states at once, and bring information from one place into another. Your mind truly is infinite, and the only limit to your potential is your threshold of awareness.\nNames and stories can really help shift gears. Reciting a mantra, singing a song, or invoking a name can all help bring you back to the place where you’ve worked with those symbols. They become like tools in your toolbox, only they grow sharper with use instead of more dull. Practice dwelling deeply within a point, but also practice bouncing quickly from place to place. Intelligence is the ability to find new points of assembly. Wisdom is the ability to recall them. Willpower is the strength to shift between them. Develop all three and you’ll be a powerful sourcerer.\nOpening the Mind Field to the Realm of Infinite Concept Up-aligned mind energies transcend space and time, linking people together and storing information in a field of energy that can be read for all time, if the right transaction conditions are present. In the higher reaches of the mind field, vibrations are more unified and thus have more access to each other, spanning time and space more easily to create a tighter mesh of thought-nodes. Creativity, intuition, and deep wisdom are available to anyone who will look within to find them. The difficulty lies in creating internal conditions that will resonate with the part of the field you seek and enable a transaction to take place.\nAny method of entering flow state can access these higher vibrations, but in order to scan them we must increase the threshold of perception. The exercises we’ve done today are designed to help create space within our local mind fields in order to make what enters much more visible. To do this we reduce stimuli physically, but also mentally, by expanding our fields and shielding them from local noise. Like dimming the lights in the theater, this space creates contrast that makes it easier to see.\nDetection alone is not enough to access infinite mind. Awareness is the fundamental action of mind, but it is choice that is the fundamental action of consciousness. Willpower is how we move the assemblage point in order to weave up and down together to create a unique enfoldment of reality. When we do not intend the form of our enfoldment, when we do not add willpower to our assemblage point, then it slides down to rest in reality of a lower energy state, whether that of the ambient culture or that of the enfoldment maintained by Nature. Each of these lower states are beautiful but limited in their own way. With the act of choosing, however, we can move the assemblage point up into the realm of infinite concept, transcending multiple realities in order to get closer to zero, or Oneness. Now, it’s true that Oneness can be accessed from the other direction, by going down, deep into a single reality, but the focus of this work is not upon such karma yoga, but the jnana yoga of accessing infinite mind.\nAs you practice making space and charging your aura, you will naturally begin to attract mind field transactions. Powerful energy will flow through you more and more. You may feel a surge of vitality, sexuality, creativity, inspiration, and spirituality, but it’s absolutely critical not to let these energies spiral out of control. Many who stimulate kundalini too quickly become trapped by power intoxication, becoming manic, losing sleep, and getting out of touch with their life. Health deteriorates until the mind is forced to shut down into an emergency repair mode. Cycles of too-much, too-little can lead to bipolar disorder, with mood swings that becoming worse and worse until the assemblage point has difficulty maintaining any position reliably. All drugs, including alcohol and sugar, will exacerbate these effects. Therefore it is critical to remain grounded and objective with your experiences. Grounded means connected to down, rooted in the life around you. Don’t take anything too personally, or the ego may run away from you. Coax those insights back into your physical memory, but don’t obsess over them. Instead, try to “ground” them into reality by making them real. Write about them. Create gifts to share with others. Focus on healing yourself and the environment. Doing these things will keep you connected to the full spectrum of consciousness and keep you from spiraling out of control. Without grounding, the spiritual experiences you have are forgotten and become lost (at least, until your assemblage point stumbles back into the appropraite vibratory range). To be in higher states of up without bringing the gifts you’re given down is a waste of time and energy. Honor the blessings you get and you’ll receive even more of them.\n"

	"content": " Expand the Local Field to Invite Information from the Realm of Infinite Concept  Open your field and let excess energy drain away into the environment. Ground yourself by imagining your feet plunged deep into cold dirt, rooted in the earth. Allow all your thoughts and emotions to seep away until you feel calm. Close your field back up by imagining a shell forming at the edges of your aura. You can seal it by saying, “Only love may enter this sacred space.” Now choose a question or a wish that’s been on your mind. Name it to yourself with a word or symbol that’s short, sweet, and carries meaning to you. Visualize that symbol floating in front of you. Now take a deep breath and, as you exhale, push energy out from your heart to the surface of your skin. Feel all your skin at once, sensing the pulse of blood feeding it, recognizing the vitality that flows through you. Now take a moment to identify some source of darkness that is taking up space in your field. Anything that comes to mind, just grab hold of it for a moment. Whether it’s judgment, self-doubt, confusion, addiction, trauma, guilt unmotivation, just scoop them all up and name them, one by one. By naming the shadows, we gain the traction we need to grab, push, and pull them into a new configuration. With another breath, push the energy out to an arm’s length or two away. Let it carry the darkness you hold and wash it away, out to the edges of awareness. This isn’t a long-term solution, but a temporary step to give us some breathing room. Press the borders of your field until your aura inflates into its natural egg shape. Strengthen the boundary by visualizing a hard shell forming around you, one to three feet away from your skin. Address the darkness with whatever name you gave it, commanding it to teach you what it can and then return to the light. Or whatever symbolism you choose to employ. Draw more light from your heart and squeeze it out throughout your aura, oozing past your shell, enveloping the darkness and burning it away with the light of understanding, compassion, and forgiveness. Just do the best you can and realize this is an ongoing process. Take a moment to breathe and enjoy a somewhat brighter, more expanded space around you. Now listen closely for a few moments, and see if your question or wish feels closer to you. Has your assemblage point moved? If you feel closer to your goal, make note of the point so that later you can find your way back more easily. Listen to see if you sense any vibrations, smell any new energies, or perhaps hear an answer to your question. This is the state of receptivity where guidance arises from higher self, which often sounds like gentle suggestions of things to avoid. The higher self rarely commands, but it will often warn. That is the act of conscience. Write down anything that comes to you.  "

	"content": " Summary Now you have a story, ideas I’ve given you about the nature of mind. It arises like cymatics from resonance patterns in the electromagnetic field. It makes impressions on awareness that may create memories. These memories become addresses that we can return to by shifting the assemblage point, a combination of awareness and intention. By learning to listen to our bodies, we can invent a language to communicate with our subtle senses in order to detect and direct mind field energy. We can use those senses to receive impressions from other mind fields and develop new language that, in turn, enables us to communicate with others on a higher plane.\nBy spending time navigating the higher planes, we gain a sense of the dimensions of infinite mind and teach ourselves how to explore further and further. By staying grounded and sharing our discoveries with others, we learn to create our own realities and get along in others, which in turn gives us more strength to keep exploring. The insights and willpower we gain from this will help us to heal our past and iron out our flaws, overcoming darkness in order to evolve.\nKeep Reinforcing Your Mind Field! Most of our negative behaviors stem from a weakened and confused mind. We all go through phases where we feel so tired and empty that we crave things to fill ourselves up. This is natural, but it gets out of hand when our auras are weak. To maintain good mental health, focus periodically upon strengthening your local mind field. Whenever you feel negative thoughts come over you, don’t bury them and don’t give in to them, but instead push them out to arm’s length, a safe distance from which you can see them clearly. Address them, heal them, and release them.\nWhenever you feel tired and depleted, don’t give in to despair and weakness, but instead give yourself time to rest and recharge. Use the power of your breath and visualization to reinforce a safe space around you. With your mind strengthened like this, you’ll be able to empathize more with the brutal reality of our world without becoming overwhelmed by it. Remember, every person influences the world with their thoughts, and when enough of us learn to use our thoughts for good, the world will begin to become a paradise again.\nBlessings on your travels,\n-KrN\n"

	"content": " Welcome to Loveway.one An Exploration of Syncretic Metaphysics You\u0026rsquo;re here because you\u0026rsquo;re curious about the nature of the unseen world. You sense in your bones that there exists something beyond what your senses show you, something that\u0026rsquo;s witnessed only by leaving the realm of ordinary consciousness and stepping into something\u0026hellip;strange. No one can give you a satisfactory explanation for what it is you sense out there. Explanations are for the rational mind and can be picked apart as easily as adopting a different point of view. True understanding transcends rationality to come alive within every aspect of your life. It\u0026rsquo;s when an idea begins to surprise and inspire you that you know you\u0026rsquo;re on to something real.\nThe cornerstone of science is replicable results. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to think that metaphysical experiences can\u0026rsquo;t be duplicated, and therefore aren\u0026rsquo;t science-able, but this misconception is based upon the limitations of our awareness. As we learn to see with multidimensional awareness, to experience life both from here and from beyond, our minds begin to fill in the gaps and finally grasp that ineffable mystery. In time we will build a framework for understanding, remembering, and sharing its secrets. The ultimate purpose of this process is to find something true, something beautiful, and something good to share with the rest of the world.\nWe are all already enlightened. Our deepest selves know the truths of life but our persona minds, the parts that have to interact with others, often forget and don\u0026rsquo;t know what do with this knowledge. I\u0026rsquo;m here to help remind you of what you already know, and to help find some language to bridge the conscious and unconscious awareness.\nI\u0026rsquo;m here to remind you that Love is the Way to One.\nBlessings on your journey,\n-KrN\n\n Use the arrow buttons to the right of this text to progress to the next article of content.\n The contents of this site are currently under heavy revision and reorganization.
