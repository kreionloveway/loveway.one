What is the Way of Love?

How is love known in the bodies of creatures?
In the gravity of objects?
In the self-knowledge of the soul?

How does love bind us together into strong families?
Into successful communities?
Into honorable nations?

How can love lead to unity
in thoughts, actions, and purpose?
In nature, business, and human need?

How is love discovered, examined, and known?
What are its aspects, archetypes, and 





Love is a real force
...that manifests as sympathy in the emotional bodies of creatures
...that manifests as gravity in the physical bodies of objects
...that manifests as self-knowledge in the spiritual minds of souls

Love binds people together
...by creating shared experiences of flourishing
...by selecting more successful adaptations
...by making meaningful stories that become sources of strength throughout life

What is the way to unity
...in thoughts, actions, purpose
...in families, communities, and nations
...in business, government, and culture?
The way is love.

What is the way to seek the true good
...in oneâ€™s personal evolution
...in supporting others to thrive
...in leaving gifts to future generations
The way is love.

You are neither physical body nor emotions nor soul. You are Love.
